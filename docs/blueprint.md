# **App Name**: Flow Factory

## Core Features:

- Admin Role: Admin user role for managing partners, global workflows, and system analytics.
- Partner Admin Role: Partner Admin role for customizing workflows, managing workers, and tracking task progress.
- Worker Role: Worker role for executing assigned tasks within workspaces and communicating via the integrated chat app.
- Workspace Switching: Multi-workspace support (like Slack) allowing workers to belong to multiple partner workspaces.
- Chat Integration: Integrated chat app for real-time communication between Partner Admins and Workers, scoped per workspace.
- AI Agent Step: AI Agent step as a workflow action (e.g., summarization, classification), so workflows can incorporate generative AI. An admin defines a generic task; the tool decides whether or not to incorporate that information, at run time.
- Role-Based Access Control: Role-based access control ensuring users can only access features and data relevant to their role and workspace.
